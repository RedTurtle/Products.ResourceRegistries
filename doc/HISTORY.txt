After 0.9
=========

 * Added test for context dependancy to inline css rendering.
   [dom]

 * Now uses restrictedTraverse() rather than getattr() for returning resources,
   to provide support for resources held within the ZODB.
   [dom]

 * Added a "is merging allowed?" option ("cookable" property) to determine where
   a resource can be merged (default True). This was added because objects in
   the ZODB may have variable permissions but be merged together. Whilst the
   objects are checked at each REQUEST, a new REQUEST won't actually be made
   each time because of the cache headers set on merged resources. If this
   worries you, the simplest solution is not to merge such resources, hence this
   option.
   [dom]

 * Added renameResource function with tests.
   [fschulze]

 * In Plone 2.1 plone_javascripts.js was removed, fixed tests by using
   jstest.js from our own skin.
   [dom]

0.9
===

 * Fixed function of enabled checkbox when adding css/javascript from ZMI.
   Added title field to the 'add stylesheet' part in the ZMI.
   [fschulze]

 * Added migration script for old instances. Just create a external method with
   id 'migrate_resourceregistries', Module Name 'ResourceRegistries.migrate' and
   Function Name 'migrate' and click on the 'Test' tab.
   [fschulze]

 * Cleaned up imports and whitespaces. Code standardization and small
   improvements. Fixed ZMI templates XHTML markup.
   [deo]

 * Refactored the two registries to use one common base class.
   [fschulze]

 * Refactored moving functions, so we have more possibilities. The API reflects
   the IOrderedContainer one.
   [fschulze]

 * Fix order of javascripts, the topmost in the management screen also needs
   to be the topmost in the resulting source.
   [fschulze]

 * Added debugmode where scripts are not concatenated. This will let things
   like the javascript console point to the right line-number. And makes it
   easier to develop, because there is no caching of the scripts.
   [fschulze]

 * Fixed cooking of stylesheets so that composite stylesheets get correct
   media settings. Thanks a lot to Denis Mishunoff[spliter] for discovery,
   investigation and suggested fix
   [elvix]

 * Fixed some security declarations.
   [fschulze]

 * Made moving of stylesheets and javascripts in ZMI possible without javascript
   being enabled in the browser.
   [fschulze]

 * Moved 2.0.5 header.pt to skins/ResourceRegistries_20compatibility and
   remove ResourceRegistries_20compatibility when Plone != 2.0.x
   [fschulze]

 * Check existance of stylesheets and javascripts before registering. This
   fixes reinstallation.
   [fschulze]

 * Removed duplicate getScripts function definition in tools/JSRegistry.py
   [fschulze]

 * Fixed JSRegistry for Plone < 2.1 where plone_utils.getSiteEncoding is not
   available.
   [fschulze]

 * Renamed config.TOOLNAME to config.CSSTOOLNAME
   and config.TOOLTYPE to config.CSSTOOLTYPE
   [batlogg]

 * Added tests for attributes on stylesheets. About time.
   [elvix]

 * Added title for alternate stylesheets.
   [fschulze]

 * Removing superflous skins directories.
   [elvix]

 * Added new debugmode where stylesheets are not concatenated. This will let
   things like the DOM inspector in Mozilla point to the right line-number.
   [ldr] [elvix]

 * Added bugfix for handling disabled items when cooking stylesheets.
   [fschulze]


0.8
===

 * Renamed to ResourceRegistries instead of the historical and wrong
   CSSRegistry.
   [elvix]

 * Upgraded JSRegistry to have a more proper ZMI form, now with reordering
   support.
   [elvix]

 * Changed the order elements are added to the JSRegistry.
   [elvix]

 * Added license/copyright notice to composite files (neccesary for including
   for third party stuff).
   [elvix]

 * Bugfix fixing ZMI form for CSSRegistry.
   [fschulze]


0.7
===

 * Added to Plone 2.1 migrations, added installation of the default
   Plone javascripts and stylesheets.
   [elvix]

 * Make sure we intercept all requests for objects, even those already
   present in the acquisition chain. Override __bobo_traverse__.
   [elvix]

 * Handle cache settings in http headers for served files.
   [elvix]

 * Handle http headers for inline scripts and stylesheets.
   [elvix]

 * Use explicit </script> tag since these pages are being served as
   text/html. Both IE and firefox will have problems otherwise.
   [bmh]


0.6 and earlier
===============

 * Added a simple readme with basic documentation.
   [elvix]

 * Started HISTORY.txt (somewhat late perhaps, but better than never).
   [elvix]

 * Cleaned up forms. Better alignment.
   [elvix]

 * Separate JSRegistry and CSSRegistry to two tools.
   [elvix]

 * Lots of changes, numerous fixes.
   [elvix]


Snowsprint 2005
===============

 * Designed and built first version of the CSSregistry.
