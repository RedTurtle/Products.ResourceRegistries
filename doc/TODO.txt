Things to do in the near future: 

  - Add support for IE-only-hack for stylesheets

  - Descriptions for the form elements in the ZMI. Some ZMI documentation

  - Stylesheet and script ordering in the ZMI panels

  - Change from dicts to classes to hold the registry information
  
  - Find a way to let Limi enforce pretty URLs for stylesheets instead of the magic numbered ones. 

  - Write install instructions
  
  - Force Limi to add better icons
  
  - Split the Plone Javascripts into components and include in the skin
  

Thoughts for the future that are not explicitly plannned for: 

  - Parsing of css into selector-level css-objects?
  
  - Controlling http cache headers from the tool 

  - PloneControlPanel interface?
