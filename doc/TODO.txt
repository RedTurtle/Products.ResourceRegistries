Things to do in the near future (not in order of priority): 

  - Add support for IE-only-hack for stylesheets

  - Descriptions for the form elements in the ZMI. Some ZMI documentation

  - Change from dicts to classes to hold the registry information?

  - Write install instructions
  
  - Better icons

  - clean up ZMI forms

Thoughts for the future that are not explicitly plannned for: 

  - Parsing of css into selector-level css-objects?

  - PloneControlPanel interface?
