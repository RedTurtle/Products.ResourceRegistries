Things to do in the near future: 

  - Make the zmi forms align a bit nicer. Have descriptions for the form elements there.

  - Stylesheet and script ordering in the ZMI panels

  - Change from dicts to classes to hold the registry information
  
  - Give stylesheets a 'rendering' attribute (with a vocabulary in the zmi) to choose the way they should be rendered. THe current way, with several boolean attributes, is backwards and wrong.

  - Find a way to let Limi enforce pretty URLs for stylesheets instead of the magic numbered ones. 
  
  - Include stylesheets with different media property in the same concatenation, just separate them from the rest with the @media selector.

  - Write install instructions
  
  - Force Limi to add better icons
  

Thoughts for the future that are not explicitly plannned for: 

  - Parsing of css into selector-level css-objects?
  
  - Controlling http cache headers from the tool 

  - PloneControlPanel interface?
