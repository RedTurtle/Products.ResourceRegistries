Things to do in the near future (not in order of priority): 

  - Add support for IE-only-hack for stylesheets

  - Descriptions for the form elements in the ZMI. Some ZMI documentation

  - Stylesheet and script ordering in the ZMI panels

  - Change from dicts to classes to hold the registry information?
  
  - Find a way to let Limi enforce pretty URLs for stylesheets instead of the magic numbered ones. 

  - Write install instructions
  
  - Better icons
  
  - Make sure http-headers are not messed up with inline css/js
  
  - add some handling of cache-headers   

  - functional tests to check that the http-header handling is correct? 

  - clean up ZMI forms

Thoughts for the future that are not explicitly plannned for: 

  - Parsing of css into selector-level css-objects?
  
  - Controlling http cache headers from the tool 

  - PloneControlPanel interface?
